# IT-Security-Project-Spring-2025

This repository contains two assignments completed for the Introduction to IT Security course at German International University (GIU) during Spring 2025. Each assignment focused on implementing a foundational cryptographic algorithm from scratch.

Assignment 1 – DES in CBC Mode (Python)
* Implemented the Data Encryption Standard (DES) manually using the pycryptodome library

* Used Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) for block-level security

  Manually handled:

* Padding (PKCS5)

* IV generation

* Block splitting and chaining

Tested with plaintext files and printed intermediate steps for clarity

Assignment 2 – RSA Algorithm (Java)
* Implemented RSA from scratch using BigInteger for key generation and modular math

Key features:

* Prime number generation
* Public/private key pair creation
* Encryption and decryption logic

Simple CLI-based user interaction
